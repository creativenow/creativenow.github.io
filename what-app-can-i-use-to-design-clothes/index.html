Crowdstar Releases Covet, A Virtual Fashion App With Real From thenextweb.com
Fashion and technical designers use illustrator to draw flat sketches (or functional sketches) with callouts for construction and styling details to put them in tech packs so your team and manufacturer can easily understand and follow. The pro.pose app is a fantastic way to do just that and it�s a lot of fun. This program might take a while to get used to but every design using phimatrix is undeniably remarkable. Plus, you can create your own mannequins, if you want to try one of your designs on a friend, or create a design just for them.
