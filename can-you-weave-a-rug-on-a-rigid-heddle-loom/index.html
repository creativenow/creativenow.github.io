RigidHeddle Rug Yarn�t You Glad… From yarntyouglad.com
Warp onto your warping peg the way you normally would for single heddle, except you will pull two loops of yarn through each slot. Take one thread from each slot and thread it in the hole to the right. Tension is also somewhat a result of technique. Once your rigid heddle loom is set up and threaded for krokbragd (which can be done either with a single heddle, pick up stick and heddle rod or with two heddles), the same three step sequence is woven over and over, the only thing that changes is your weft colours.

<p>The weft will go over one thread then under the next across the row. Secondly, the cogs on most rigid heddles are not strong enough to maintain the tension needed for rug weaving, and the looms themselves are not sturdy enough to withstand the pressure of a heavy rug warp.
